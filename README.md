# caseoppgave-bysykkel

My solution for showing list of Bysykkel stations and the available bikes and parking spots.

Project is made using Vite (https://vitejs.dev/) and react-bootstrap (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
API is hosted by: https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-data/sanntid

Make sure you have updated Node.js

Run using - npm install 
          - npm run dev


Known bugs:
- Expanding one accordion will reverse state when using Expand/Collaps-button
